# Sleeping Teacher Assistant OS
#  PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project is a simulation of a scenario where multiple students seek help from a teaching assistant (TA). The TA can only help one student at a time, and there are a limited number of chairs outside the TA's office where students can wait. The project uses multithreading and semaphores to manage the interactions between students and the TA.
